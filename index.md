## Molecule of the Week:
### Rapamycin

Rapamycin is an unusual immunosuppressant discovered on Easter Island (Rapa Nui), quite different from the other molecules discussed here in terms of structure, uses, and how it relates to the environment. Rapamycin was extracted from <em>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</em> on Easter Island in 1972. Since then, this drug has gone from being a believed antifungal agent to now being recognized as a life-saving immunosuppressant among other effects. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) which doesn’t initially tell us anything about its function because it is part of the definition. I am not a biologist so I will try to keep this explanation simple. mTOR is an enzyme which is basically responsible for regulating cell growth and proliferation. By inhibiting it, cell growth is decreased. Besides the simple use of it as an immunosuppressant for transplants, this growth regulation opens numerous possibilities. For example, diseases or conditions which cause growths, whether they be cancerous or not, including tuberous sclerosis complex and potentially even cancer can be treated with rapamycin. In fact, it may even slow aging and increase life spans. It is certain there is a lot to research currently regarding both positive and negative effects of this drug. The main reason I have selected this molecule this week is not due to its potentially miraculous effects: I have selected it due to the question of biodiversity. We know conclusively that biodiversity of flora and fauna are decreasing and that the same holds true for both the skin and gut microbiomes – see Wallen-Russell, Christopher et al (2023). If the biodiversity of bacteria is decreasing in the environment, humanity will be affected in a very interesting way: drug discovery. Drugs like rapamycin are only discovered because they are produced by some strain of bacteria in the wild: even if we can synthesize the drug, we most likely would never have discovered it on our own due to its complexity. It is easy to look at drugs discovered in the Amazon and understand that we are inhibiting the discovery of future drugs due to climate change, fires, and more. But it is also important to consider the molecules discovered in microbes – and the devastating effects of potentially decreasing bacterial biodiversity. What continues to be certain is the vast range of negative effects at all scales due to anthropogenic climate change and pollution.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
