## Molecule of the Week:
### DDT

In honor of Earth Day being this past week, I have chosen one of, if not the most, important molecules in the history of environmental chemistry and science. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, also known as DDT, is an insecticide famously or infamously known for its effects on the environment. DDT is actually a very good insecticide – in fact its discovery led to a Nobel Prize due to its use in countering malaria. Despite its hazards, it is still used by the WHO in some countries for this reason. In 1962, biologist Rachel Carson published the book that led to the creation of the EPA: <em>Silent Spring</em>. Carson questioned the indiscriminate usage of DDT in agriculture, discussing the effects of it on humans and birds. Famously, DDT thins the eggshells of birds, most notably bald eagles. DDT also biomagnifies through the food chain, affecting a whole host of other organisms. In addition, DDT is considered to be a carcinogen, but the reason for this is not quite fully understood. Even if DDT only impacted 1 species, the results would be detrimental to the environment. Something that I believe a lot of people still don’t understand is how linked everything is in the environment: removing or introducing a single species can be catastrophic. For those who think this doesn’t happen anymore, look no further than Idaho. Idaho has put into place laws that pay people to kill and mercilessly slaughter wolves: reducing the number from 1500 to 150. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out how much this screws up the ecosystem: too many deer, leading to fewer plants, leading to a whole cascade of catastrophe. In California, it was recently discovered that some marijuana was grown illegally with chlorfenapyr, an absolutely horrendous pesticide illegal in the US that kills nearly everything in the environment, including humans. Dozens of other pesticides were being used with no respect for human health or the environment. 63 years after <em>Silent Spring</em> and 55 years after the creation of the EPA, the ideas expressed regarding fully understanding and regulating molecules we put into the environment and the importance of species (whether it’s just 1 or 100), remain incredibly relevant.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
