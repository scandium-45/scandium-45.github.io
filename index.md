Atrazine is a controversial 1,3,5-triazine herbicide. Interestingly, we have already seen this structure a few weeks back with melamine, which is a 1,3,5-triazine with amines on the 2,4, and 6 carbons. This structural motif means that atrazine and similar compounds shut the electron transport chain down in plants by binding to the protein plastoquinone normally binds to. Because humans and other animals lack this, we are immune from this effect. However, there is some evidence that atrazine carries a few other negative effects in humans and animals. Studies like Hayes, Tyrone B et al. (2010) suggest that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor and can feminize African clawed frogs. However, this study has been criticized for flaws in the experimental design and has not been replicated. There is also some fear that atrazine may be teratogenic or carcinogenic. This has also not been proven. Although banned in Europe, the EPA has reviewed the compound multiple times and concluded that if there are urgent risks they will take action on atrazine, which is currently legal. Of concern is atrazine’s accumulation in certain watersheds, which can and does exceed established safety limits. To reiterate, atrazine has been studied by the EPA and has not been shown to be dangerous in low concentrations, like in the low 1 digit parts per billion. However, it is concerning that as a pollutant, it has become more concentrated in some bodies of water. Atrazine doesn’t deserve the hate it gets, but that also doesn’t mean it is perfectly safe. For more current information, such as the concentration at which aquatic plants are impacted (as of March 2025, it is 9.7 micrograms per liter), visit the EPA’s page on atrazine at https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/atrazine.   <br>

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

<br/>
My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
