## Molecule of the Week:
### Dihydroquinine

Dihydroquinine (DHQ), also known as hydroquinine, is a derivative of quinine with usage in asymmetric synthesis. In 2001, K. Barry Sharpless won his first of 2 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry partially for the discovery of what is now known as Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. This reaction uses osmium tetroxide as an oxidizer and uses a reoxidant, commonly potassium ferricyanide or NMO (sound familiar?). However, what makes this reaction special is the usage of an asymmetric catalyst which makes the dihydroxylation enantioselective. Both of the catalysts use phthalazine as an adduct (not actually important), but use different chiral ligands to make the reaction enantioselective. One of these ligands is the molecule of the week, DHQ, while the other ligand you use for the opposite stereochemistry is the closely related dihydroquinidine, which is the enantiomer of DHQ (just change the wedge bonds to dashed bonds). With Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, alkenes can be dihydroxylated selectively such that only 1 enantiomer is made. This has huge implications in cases where a molecule has to have a certain stereochemistry, like drugs. Although this reaction isn’t perfect (depending on the steric environment of the alkene and whether it is cis or trans, selectivity varies somewhat), it is a great and relatively easy way of synthesizing 1 enantiomer. In fact, Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation is actually faster than Upjohn dihydroxylation (non-asymmetric) as a result of what Sharpless called ligand accelerated catalysis. Additionally, the various reagents or compounds used to generate them <i>in situ</i> are commercially available in what is called AD-mix. For just the low, low price of $59.28, you too (provided you can actually order it) can buy 10 grams of AD-mix-alpha from Sigma-Aldrich and perform a Nobel Prize winning reaction.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

<br/>
My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
