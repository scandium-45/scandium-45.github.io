## Molecule of the Week:
### Ferrocene

Ferrocene: the first of many molecules I have been interested in writing about for a while, but have been scared away by the task of trying to represent their structures. You may have noticed that I have not posted a 3-D structure due to this compound’s unique geometry; this may happen again with other similar compounds or ionic salts, which cannot be represented as just a 3-D molecule. With these logistics out of the way, I proudly present ferrocene. 
<br>
Ferrocene is the prototypical metallocene, an interesting group of molecules which are the most common of the sandwich compounds – a name which is rather appropriate. First synthesized in 1951, ferrocene led to a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1973 for two of the chemists involved: Ernst Otto Fischer and Geoffrey Wilkinson. What is interesting about ferrocene and led to the Nobel Prize was not any reactions or applications of ferrocene, but the unique sandwich structure. The iron(II) in the middle of the sandwich isn’t really connected to any 1 carbon atom, as evidenced by the bonds which pass directly into the center of the cyclopentadienyl rings. Although this appears, and is complicated, these compounds have the same electron configuration of the noble gas in the period (6 pi electrons per cyclopentadienyl and 6 from iron(II)), somewhat explaining the stability of ferrocene and similar metallocenes. Even more complicated is the orientation of the cyclopentadienyl rings: depending on the temperature and phase, the rings may obtain various staggered or eclipsed conformations. For more information, I recommend checking out the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model, but this is far outside the scope of this blog and my understanding of organometallic chemistry. To be honest, I just picked ferrocene as a molecule because it is a relatively silly molecule: the electrons seemingly disobey rules, the molecule is relatively useless besides a few niche applications, and sandwich compound is a funny name. Chemistry is full of these rather unusual, if not silly, molecules that upon inspection, push the limits of our understanding of electrons and bonding. I hope to show a few more of these molecules eventually.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

<br/>
My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
