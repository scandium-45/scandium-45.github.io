<i>N</i>-methylmorpholine <i>N</i>-oxide, commonly known as NMO, is one example of a molecule hinted at last week. NMO is a sacrificial catalyst and reoxidant, meaning that it is responsible for catalyzing a reaction by oxidizing the actual catalyst in a reaction. Technically, because it is not regenerated in a reaction like a catalyst, sacrificial catalysts are actually just reagents, despite the name. NMO is often used (other reoxidants like potassium ferricyanide also can work) as a method of regenerating osmium tetroxide, which itself is used in special oxidation reactions as discussed last week. For example, in Upjohn dihydroxylation (named after the former Upjohn Company), NMO is used in reagent/stoichiometric quantities to help regenerate osmium tetroxide, which is used very sparingly. Through this reaction, you can get all the benefits of osmium tetroxide while only using a tiny amount of it (which is both safer and cheaper) due to NMO regenerating osmium tetroxide after it has already reacted. This reaction, just like the normal osmium tetroxide oxidation reaction, is not stereospecific, meaning that the osmium tetroxide can attack from either face of the alkene, often resulting in a mixture of enantiomers. This mixture is known as a racemic mixture. Surprisingly, forcing this reaction to be stereospecific and produce just one enantiomer – as we will see next week – makes this reaction work faster and give higher yields, which is somewhat counterintuitive. Overall, so-called sacrificial catalysts and reoxidants represent a great way of regenerating catalysts, allowing reactions to proceed smoothly with only a very tiny amount of what may be a dangerous and/or expensive catalyst.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

<br/>
My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
