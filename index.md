## Molecule of the Week:
### Ascaridole

Ascaridole is an interesting, naturally-occurring monoterpenoid that happens to look like a face in 2-D. Ascaridole occurs in the boldo tree of Chile and epazote, an herb which grows across Latin America. Bicyclic compounds are quite common in nature (camphor, eucalyptol, pinene, etc.) but I can’t say that I have ever seen a natural bicyclic bridging peroxide. It isn’t surprising as a result of this peroxide bridge to reveal that this molecule is relatively flammable, and some sources online regard ascaridole as being quite explosive. However, this is wrong: the peroxide bond of ascaridole does violently break with heat, but the main cycloalkene structure remains intact (unlike with other organic peroxide explosives where the entire molecule breaks apart). Hence, ascaridole is not very explosive. Besides this unusual property, ascaridole has an interesting use as an anthelmintic drug, meaning that it expels parasitic worms. However, ascaridole has mainly been used historically because it is a strong irritant and a potential carcinogen. As far as pre-1970s anti-parasitic drugs go in terms of danger (I’m looking at you, melarsoprol), this isn’t actually too bad if it means treating a parasitic infestation. There are certainly better options now, but they probably won’t be as interesting-looking of a molecule.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at Rice University, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.


### Nuclear and Radiochemistry

After a brief stint at Brookhaven National Laboratory as part of the Nuclear Chemistry Summer School this past summer, I am certainly more interested in nuclear chemistry than before. Much of this revolves around my initial interest in organometallic and inorganic complexation chemistry. I am interested in extending the traditions of organometallic and non-covalent complexation chemistry to the actinides, a woefully under-studied subject. The interactions of actinides in terms of covalent bonding, host-guest chemistry, and other ionic complexation is interesting theoretically for understanding actinides and has potential uses in separation of actinides, such as in nuclear reprocessing. I hope to continue to develop my techniques with non-radioactive d and f block metals before potentially looking at actinide chemistry. 


### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

My research project at Cal Poly involved Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage, carbon capture, water filtration, and more. I tackled the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This was quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we tried to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. I discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a dilute solution of aniline with scandium(iii) triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst. While I am now at Rice, the Hamachi group will continue to work on covalent organic frameworks and I would recommend checking out their latest work.
