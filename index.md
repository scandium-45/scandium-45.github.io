## Molecule of the Week:
### Vasicine

Vasicine is an alkaloid and quinazoline derivative found mainly in <em>Justicia adhatoda</em>, aka Malabar nut. This plant is a flowering shrub native to Asia, mainly parts of South and Southeast Asia. Vasicine, like many other alkaloids, has been historically used in traditional medicines. Vasicine has multiple effects on the body both as a stimulant and a depressant to different organs and systems. While this may be interesting to certain people, I have picked this molecule for an entirely different reason. While researching the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline on my quest to determine if I could synthesize deuterated benzonitrile, I discovered a paper detailing the usage of vasicine as a reducing agent. I was looking for preferably a metal-free, non-dangerous, and cost efficient reaction and I was pleasantly surprised to find this paper, Sharma, Sushila et al (2014). I was further shocked to learn that vasicine was an abundant natural product. As a supporter of green chemistry, I was pleased at how well this reaction works and how economical it is. There are many other redox agents used in green chemistry including vitamin C and other plant extracts, and it is always good to see the discovery of another. For the sake of safety and the environment, I hope that eventually the majority of redox reactions will be done using green chemistry. It is also important to remember the conclusion of the previous molecule of the week: as the climate changes, chemistry will become harder as we may lose access to useful natural products.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
