## Molecule of the Week:
### Allyl Isothiocyanate

Allyl isothiocyanate, a molecule you may not have heard of, but have certainly encountered. This natural product is present in and responsible for the flavor and pungency of horseradish, wasabi, mustard, and other cruciferous vegetables. As delicious as these foods are, allyl isothiocyanate is rarely found on its own. This is quite fortunate for humans because pure allyl isothiocyanate is actually relatively toxic with an LD50 is 151 mg/kg – slightly more toxic than MDMA and sodium nitrite. In addition, allyl isothiocyanate is a lachrymatory agent, like tear gas. In addition to being used in food, its toxicity in pure form is put to use in the form of insecticides and antibiotics. Additionally, there is some research currently ongoing into possible anti-cancer and anti-tumor effects of allyl isothiocyanate. Allyl isothiocyanate cements itself as one of the most important and most global of flavor molecules. In future weeks, I will discuss other flavor molecules responsible for the taste of foods like garlic, onions, shiitake mushrooms, and the subtle flavors of cheeses, wines, and more. Interestingly, all these molecules share something in common: they contain sulfur, my favorite element.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
