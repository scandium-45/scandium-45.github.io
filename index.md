## Molecule of the Week:
### Thionyl Chloride

Thionyl chloride has amazing potential: it can produce acyl chlorides from carboxylic acids, nitriles from primary amides, alkyl chlorides from alcohols, and more. Interestingly, with the production of alkyl chlorides, thionyl chloride can produce stereochemical retention, inversion, or a mix, depending on the solvent/presence of other molecules in solution, a property not seen with other chlorinating agents. This seems to be more of an ACS exam gimmick than an actually used laboratory technique for asymmetric synthesis, though. Despite its pros, thionyl chloride probably shouldn’t be used much beyond niche industrial applications and solving synthesis problems on paper. Thionyl chloride, to put it mildly, is horrible to work with. It is a volatile liquid that fumes on exposure to air because it reacts with water in the air to produce hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide gas. If it actually comes into contact with substantial amounts of water, this same reaction will happen quite violently and exothermically. Above its relatively low boiling point, it decomposes into more sulfur dioxide, chlorine gas, and various sulfur chlorides. These sulfur chlorides are also fuming, and will react violently and exothermically with water to make even more sulfur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and sulfur. Thionyl chloride will also violently and exothermically react with alkali and alkaline earth metals, spontaneously starting fires. Even if you still really desire to work with it, there is one more hurdle: it is a regulated substance under the Chemical Weapons Convention because it can be used to make nerve agents and sulfur-based mustard gases. Overall, thionyl chloride would arguably be one of the greatest chemistry reagents if it just wasn’t so evil of a molecule.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at Rice University, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.


### Nuclear and Radiochemistry

After a brief stint at Brookhaven National Laboratory as part of the Nuclear Chemistry Summer School this past summer, I am certainly more interested in nuclear chemistry than before. Much of this revolves around my initial interest in organometallic and inorganic complexation chemistry. I am interested in extending the traditions of organometallic and non-covalent complexation chemistry to the actinides, a woefully under-studied subject. The interactions of actinides in terms of covalent bonding, host-guest chemistry, and other ionic complexation is interesting theoretically for understanding actinides and has potential uses in separation of actinides, such as in nuclear reprocessing. I hope to continue to develop my techniques with non-radioactive d and f block metals before potentially looking at actinide chemistry. 


### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

My research project at Cal Poly involved Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage, carbon capture, water filtration, and more. I tackled the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This was quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we tried to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. I discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a dilute solution of aniline with scandium(iii) triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst. While I am now at Rice, the Hamachi group will continue to work on covalent organic frameworks and I would recommend checking out their latest work.
