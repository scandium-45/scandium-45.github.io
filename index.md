## Molecule of the Week:
### Carvone

This week is unique in that there are 2 molecules, yet both are carvone. How can this be? These 2 molecules are enantiomers of each other, meaning that they are non-superimposable mirror images of each other (it is possible to see this if you rotate each molecule in opposite directions facing each other). The bottom carbon of the cyclohexene ring (the hexagon) is an asymmetric, or chiral, carbon, meaning that it is connected to four different atoms or groups of atoms. I have tried to showcase this chirality (and not the mirror-image) by just focusing on the chiral carbon. On R-carvone, the hydrogen goes back (represented in 2-D with the dashed bond) while the other carbon group comes forward (represented in 2-D with the solid, wedge bond); the inverse is true for S-carvone. These two enantiomers cannot be switched or rotated to get the other without breaking bonds. This chiral carbon is the reason they are enantiomers and is why I have chosen to focus on it. This can be easily seen below in the hypothetical compound, bromochlorofluoromethane, a molecule with just one carbon that is chiral. <br>

I will quickly elaborate on the naming of the 2 carvones. R and S (right and left from the Latin <i>rectus</i> and <i>sinister</i>) refer to the absolute configuration, or 3-D orientation of the enantiomers. The plus and minus refer to the direction at which polarized light is rotated by each enantiomer; this is sometimes written instead with D and L (right and left from the Latin <i>dextro</i> and <i>levo</i>). This seems strange to use, but historically, it was the only way to separate/identify enantiomers. Biologists love naming amino acids and drugs with levo and dextro for some reason but we chemists dislike this for a simple reason: I can look at a molecule and tell you immediately it is R or S, but currently, we cannot look at a molecule and predict which way it will rotate light. In short, if you tell a chemist to draw (<i>R</i>)-carvone, they can, but they wouldn’t know if it was dextro (+) or levo (-) carvone without testing.
<br>
Despite the 3-D configuration differences, both molecules have the same physical properties, like boiling/melting points, density, solubility in water, etc. How they smell paints a different picture: both carvones are found in nature in essential oils but (<i>S</i>)-carvone is present in and smells like caraway, and (<i>R</i>)-carvone is present in and smells like spearmint. The reason for this smell difference is quite simple: humans, like all of life, are full of enantiomers, which extends to our smell receptors. Only one of these carvone enantiomers ‘fits’ in one receptor, and the other enantiomer ‘fits’ in another receptor. These 2 receptors send different signals to the brain and the brain interprets them as 2 very different smells (it’s easy to forget that senses, like smell, aren’t inherent physical properties). This chirality of the body is why the configuration, or what we call stereochemistry, is so important for molecules that go in the body, like drugs. For example methamphetamine is chiral and only one of the enantiomers is what we know as ‘meth’; the other, levomethamphetamine, is an over-the-counter nasal decongestant.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
