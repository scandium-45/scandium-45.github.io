## Molecule of the Week:
### Melamine

Melamine has a few uses in the plastics and polymers industries for making resins, foams, plasticizers, laminates, and more. Melamine also appears in the structures of a few important drugs, like melarsoprol, which is used to treat African sleeping sickness. However, the most notable aspect of melamine is the fact that it is extraordinarily nitrogen-rich (66% by mass). As a result, it has gained infamy for being added to food as a form of doping. Basically, many tests used to assess the protein content of food rely on measuring nitrogen content because proteins are made of amino acids and linked by amides, resulting in most of the nitrogen of food being in proteins. Thus, when melamine is added to foods, like in the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, it makes it seem like the protein content is much higher. It is then possible to water down the product or sell a less-healthy version while making it seem protein-rich. Not only is this very unethical, melamine is toxic and when consumed, leads to crystal formation in the kidneys which causes severe kidney and bladder damage. <br>

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

<br/>
My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
