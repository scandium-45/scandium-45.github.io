## Molecule of the Week:
### Ascorbic Acid

Ascorbic acid, aka Vitamin C, aka L-ascorbic acid (unnecessary because D-ascorbic acid is actually called erythorbic acid) is an incredibly useful molecule, perhaps more so than anything seen so far. In addition to being a vitamin found in countless fruits and vegetables, an antioxidant added to foods, and a dietary supplement used to treat or prevent scurvy, ascorbic acid finds countless uses in organic chemistry, specifically pertaining to green chemistry. Vitamin C is often first encountered in the beloved iodine clock reaction, a classic science fair or chemistry magic show demonstration that first captured my heart many years ago (watch a video of this reaction if you haven’t seen it; it’s more magical than I can describe with words). This reaction showcases the redox capabilities of ascorbic acid: the iodine is reduced (gains electrons) by ascorbic acid to form colorless iodide ions. Once the ascorbic acid has become fully oxidized (loses electrons) with the help of hydrogen peroxide, the iodine will be able to freely complex with starch, leading to a very sudden color change. Ascorbic acid finds use as a reducing agent outside of science fairs though. Ascorbic acid has historically been used as a reducing agent in green chemistry (see vasicine from 7 weeks ago) with roles like reducing graphene oxide and reducing many functional groups. Ascorbic acid has also been used as a reducing agent in atom transfer radical polymerization. Furthermore, recent research has highlighted the usage of ascorbic acid as a catalyst in organic synthesis, both due to its redox capabilities as well as its stereochemistry which can help with asymmetric synthesis. It’s rare to find a molecule that is either a good agent in synthesis or useful biologically, but ascorbic acid manages to do both.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

<br/>
My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
