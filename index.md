## Molecule of the Week:
### Osmium Tetroxide

Osmium tetroxide is an interesting molecule: it is colorless but it usually appears yellow from impurities, it forms crystals, it is volatile and sublimes readily at room temperature, and its bonds are mostly covalent (as opposed to osmium having a charge of 8+). Osmium tetroxide is also quite toxic because it can enter cells due to its nonpolar nature. It can cause chemical burns to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, stain corneas causing blindness (permanent), and chronically damages the liver and kidneys over time. If these weren’t bad enough, osmium tetroxide is very expensive and can cost hundreds of dollars per gram. Finally, potassium permanganate (which is far cheaper, safer, and easier to handle) can perform a similar reaction. Despite this all, osmium tetroxide is arguably one of the most important reagents in organic synthesis. 
Both osmium tetroxide and potassium permanganate react with alkenes to form an interesting cyclic intermediate; upon hydrolysis, the alkene has been converted to an alkane and the 2 adjacent carbons have a hydroxy/alcohol group attached (vicinal diol). Due to the structure of the ring intermediate, the addition is syn, meaning that both additions happen on the same face of the molecule and the bonds are pointed in the same direction (recall the stereochemistry discussion from last week). To summarize, an alkene has been converted to an alkane and now both carbons have an alcohol group pointing in the same direction (cis diol). You often still get enantiomers depending on which side of the alkene is attacked by the osmium tetroxide, however.

This reaction is quite important because of the syn addition, but it doesn’t explain why anyone would use this seemingly horrible reagent over potassium permanganate. The first topic is reactivity: potassium permanganate is a stronger oxidizer and it can over-oxidize and break apart the diol, even if the solution is cool and dilute. This can lead to impurities and lower yields for potassium permanganate. Also due to this higher reactivity, potassium permanganate can react with alkynes, unlike osmium tetroxide; sometimes, though not always, this reaction is not desired. Finally, osmium tetroxide is used in some modified oxidation reactions. I don’t want to spoil things too much for the next 2 weeks as we discuss some of these other reagents, but some molecules can regenerate the osmium tetroxide, meaning that you can use a tiny, far less expensive amount. Furthermore, with the addition of certain ligands, you can tune the reaction so just one enantiomer is produced, allowing for the stereoselective synthesis of molecules like drugs as discussed last week. It is important to remember however that potassium permanganate is still very useful; in fact, in many if not most cases, it is the better reagent. As we will see in the next 2 weeks, osmium tetroxide can really only do a few things, but it can do them at a level no other molecule can compete at.

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. My favorite element is sulfur and my favorite molecule is grapefruit mercaptan (yes, that is actually its name). Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

<br/>
My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
