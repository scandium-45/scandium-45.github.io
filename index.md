## Molecule of the Week:
### EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid)

<br>
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or EDTA, is an incredibly useful ligand, meaning it binds to metal atoms to form a coordination complex. Due to the abundance of lone pairs on this molecule, once deprotonated, it is a hexadentate ligand, meaning it forms an incredible 6 bonds with a central metal atom/ion. Thus, EDTA can effectively sequester metal ions from solution and lock them away tightly in a coordination complex, preventing any reactions with the metal. Examples of this being useful are abundant. It is used in chelation therapy to treat lead poisoning, in the paper industry to prevent metal ions from helping hydrogen peroxide break down into water and oxygen, as a water softener in agriculture and laundry, and in many other applications and fields. Although not super harmful, its usage is being questioned because it breaks down very slowly in the environment. Mainly, it degrades under UV light, although bacteria that can break down specific EDTA-metal complexes have been discovered. <br>

## My Story
I am currently a chemistry major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and I am deeply passionate about organic chemistry and the environment, especically concerning climate change. Here's a few things I am interested in or have already done.

### Covalent Organic Frameworks

<br/>
My current research project at Cal Poly involves Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), a class of porous, crystalline polymers. They have interesting applications in gas storage - including carbon capture, water filtration, and other environmental applications. Currently, I am tackling the depolymerization of an imine-linked COF, COF-300 (shown above). This is quite difficult due to the strength of the imine bonds. Additionally, because the idea is to use this for recycling of COFs, we are trying to avoid unnecessarily complex and hazardous methods. So far, I have discovered that this COF can be depolymerized somewhat in a very dilute solution of aniline with Scandium(III) Triflate as a Lewis acid catalyst.

### (Synthetic Organic) Electrochemistry
As the first image shows, I really enjoy a good storm. In fact, back in February 2024, I had the pleasure of witnessing an intense line of thunderstorms plow through coastal central California. In fact, two EF1 tornadoes (both with winds of 95 mph) came within a few miles of me. The chemistry of thunderstorms is equally as fascinating as the physics and meteorology. Due to the extremely high current from lightning, molecules like water and dinitrogen, are blasted apart and smashed together, forming some interesting radicals that bearly last a tenth of a second before they react. In fact, two of these radicals, hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl, actually destroy greenhouse gases when they violently react. These atmospheric radicals are currently being investigated for their role in the climate and in climate change. 
Interestingly as well, electrochemistry is now being applied to the field of synthetic organic chemistry, producing the new and upcoming field of synthetic organic electrochemistry. With synthetic organic electrochemistry, useful molecules, like drug precursors and agrochemicals, can be produced more selectively, better, and without the need of redox reagents by using electricity. Oxidations and reductions are done using a range of anodes and cathodes to precisely create the exact redox potential needed for a reaction to occur. The electricity basically does the chemistry for you!
