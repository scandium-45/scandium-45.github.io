<br>
Perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, is a useful industrial surfactant, meaning that it is used to decrease surface tension of water. It is also used as a material feedstock. PFOA is used in a vast number of places and products including clothes, furniture, waxes, and more, and it does its intended job quite well. The small problem with PFOA is that, like other per and poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), it is a forever chemical, meaning it almost never breaks down. This is largely due to the carbon-fluorine bond, one of the strongest single bonds known. PFOA is also a potential (and likely) carcinogen. Combined with the previously discussed bioaccumulation as a forever chemical, it is easy to see why this and similar compounds are being phased out. <br>

### EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid)

<br>
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or EDTA, is an incredibly useful ligand, meaning it binds to metal atoms to form a coordination complex. Due to the abundance of lone pairs on this molecule, once deprotonated, it is a hexadentate ligand, meaning it forms an incredible 6 bonds with a central metal atom/ion. Thus, EDTA can effectively sequester metal ions from solution and lock them away tightly in a coordination complex, preventing any reactions with the metal. Examples of this being useful are abundant. It is used in chelation therapy to treat lead poisoning, in the paper industry to prevent metal ions from helping hydrogen peroxide break down into water and oxygen, as a water softener in agriculture and laundry, and in many other applications and fields. Although not super harmful, its usage is being questioned because it breaks down very slowly in the environment. Mainly, it degrades under UV light, although bacteria that can break down specific EDTA-metal complexes have been discovered. <br>

### Melamine

<img src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c65f08ad-31d0-4457-9181-5f7c0d8b2fc5" alt="Melamine, a notable plastics chemical and toxin" width="300" height="180">
<br>
Melamine has a few uses in the plastics and polymers industries for making resins, foams, plasticizers, laminates, and more. Melamine also appears in the structures of a few important drugs, like melarsoprol, which is used to treat African sleeping sickness. However, the most notable aspect of melamine is the fact that it is extraordinarily nitrogen-rich (66% by mass). As a result, it has gained infamy for being added to food as a form of doping. Basically, many tests used to assess the protein content of food rely on measuring nitrogen content because proteins are made of amino acids and linked by amides, resulting in most of the nitrogen of food being in proteins. Thus, when melamine is added to foods, like in the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, it makes it seem like the protein content is much higher. It is then possible to water down the product or sell a less-healthy version while making it seem protein-rich. Not only is this very unethical, melamine is toxic and when consumed, leads to crystal formation in the kidneys which causes severe kidney and bladder damage. <br> 

### 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-<em>p</em>-dioxin

<br>
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-<em>p</em>-dioxin, also known as TCDD, is an infamous pollutant, toxin, and cancer promoter. TCDD first gained infamy as a contaminant in Agent Orange, leading to a vast number of Vietnamese people being exposed to it. Despite the relatively low concentration of TCDD, health effects including a large number of cancers and birth defects have been observed in the years since. TCDD is not directly carcinogenic except in high doses, but it acts as a cancer promoter. This means that the effects of any other carcinogens in someone are increased, often substantially, leading to cancer. TCDD has also served as a serious pollutant also due to low level contamination. For example, the town of Times Beach, Missouri, was polluted with TCDD after dirt roads were sprayed with waste oil containing traces of it. The town became a Superfund site, was evacuated, cleaned, and is now a ghost town although it is now safe. TCDD serves as an important reminder of the impact of contaminants on people and the environment. In neither of the cases above was TCDD an intended product but it still was present in the low ppm ranges. Our understanding of TCDD and similar compounds continues to grow which will hopefully lead to fewer exposures, better cleanups, and better treatment for victims. In the meantime, it is important we understand the danger of these incredibly dangerous contaminants.
