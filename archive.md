<br>
Perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, is a useful industrial surfactant, meaning that it is used to decrease surface tension of water. It is also used as a material feedstock. PFOA is used in a vast number of places and products including clothes, furniture, waxes, and more, and it does its intended job quite well. The small problem with PFOA is that, like other per and poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), it is a forever chemical, meaning it almost never breaks down. This is largely due to the carbon-fluorine bond, one of the strongest single bonds known. PFOA is also a potential (and likely) carcinogen. Combined with the previously discussed bioaccumulation as a forever chemical, it is easy to see why this and similar compounds are being phased out. <br>

### EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid)

<img src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1fb147-673f-4b20-b483-a2ab0eb4ea33" alt="Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA), a useful hexadentate ligand" width="300" height="180">
<br>
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or EDTA, is an incredibly useful ligand, meaning it binds to metal atoms to form a coordination complex. Due to the abundance of lone pairs on this molecule, once deprotonated, it is a hexadentate ligand, meaning it forms an incredible 6 bonds with a central metal atom/ion. Thus, EDTA can effectively sequester metal ions from solution and lock them away tightly in a coordination complex, preventing any reactions with the metal. Examples of this being useful are abundant. It is used in chelation therapy to treat lead poisoning, in the paper industry to prevent metal ions from helping hydrogen peroxide break down into water and oxygen, as a water softener in agriculture and laundry, and in many other applications and fields. Although not super harmful, its usage is being questioned because it breaks down very slowly in the environment. Mainly, it degrades under UV light, although bacteria that can break down specific EDTA-metal complexes have been discovered. <br>

### Melamine

<img src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c65f08ad-31d0-4457-9181-5f7c0d8b2fc5" alt="Melamine, a notable plastics chemical and toxin" width="300" height="180">
<br>
Melamine has a few uses in the plastics and polymers industries for making resins, foams, plasticizers, laminates, and more. Melamine also appears in the structures of a few important drugs, like melarsoprol, which is used to treat African sleeping sickness. However, the most notable aspect of melamine is the fact that it is extraordinarily nitrogen-rich (66% by mass). As a result, it has gained infamy for being added to food as a form of doping. Basically, many tests used to assess the protein content of food rely on measuring nitrogen content because proteins are made of amino acids and linked by amides, resulting in most of the nitrogen of food being in proteins. Thus, when melamine is added to foods, like in the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, it makes it seem like the protein content is much higher. It is then possible to water down the product or sell a less-healthy version while making it seem protein-rich. Not only is this very unethical, melamine is toxic and when consumed, leads to crystal formation in the kidneys which causes severe kidney and bladder damage. <br> 

### 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-<em>p</em>-dioxin

<br>
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-<em>p</em>-dioxin, also known as TCDD, is an infamous pollutant, toxin, and cancer promoter. TCDD first gained infamy as a contaminant in Agent Orange, leading to a vast number of Vietnamese people being exposed to it. Despite the relatively low concentration of TCDD, health effects including a large number of cancers and birth defects have been observed in the years since. TCDD is not directly carcinogenic except in high doses, but it acts as a cancer promoter. This means that the effects of any other carcinogens in someone are increased, often substantially, leading to cancer. TCDD has also served as a serious pollutant also due to low level contamination. For example, the town of Times Beach, Missouri, was polluted with TCDD after dirt roads were sprayed with waste oil containing traces of it. The town became a Superfund site, was evacuated, cleaned, and is now a ghost town although it is now safe. TCDD serves as an important reminder of the impact of contaminants on people and the environment. In neither of the cases above was TCDD an intended product but it still was present in the low ppm ranges. Our understanding of TCDD and similar compounds continues to grow which will hopefully lead to fewer exposures, better cleanups, and better treatment for victims. In the meantime, it is important we understand the danger of these incredibly dangerous contaminants. For more information, I highly recommend this NIOSH publication: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/84-104/default.html  <br>

### Atrazine
<img src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0817b4ba-20a0-4841-93d7-50fc810b5c79" alt="Atrazine, a controversial triazine herbicide" width="320" height="180">
<img src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ba43a68-a1d1-4430-9100-2243d45afa36" alt="Atrazine, a controversial triazine herbicide" width="320" height="180">
<br>
Atrazine is a controversial 1,3,5-triazine herbicide. Interestingly, we have already seen this structure a few weeks back with melamine, which is a 1,3,5-triazine with amines on the 2,4, and 6 carbons. This structural motif means that atrazine and similar compounds shut the electron transport chain down in plants by binding to the protein plastoquinone normally binds to. Because humans and other animals lack this, we are immune from this effect. However, there is some evidence that atrazine carries a few other negative effects in humans and animals. Studies like Hayes, Tyrone B et al. (2010) suggest that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor and can feminize African clawed frogs. However, this study has been criticized for flaws in the experimental design and has not been replicated. There is also some fear that atrazine may be teratogenic or carcinogenic. This has also not been proven. Although banned in Europe, the EPA has reviewed the compound multiple times and concluded that if there are urgent risks they will take action on atrazine, which is currently legal. Of concern is atrazine’s accumulation in certain watersheds, which can and does exceed established safety limits. To reiterate, atrazine has been studied by the EPA and has not been shown to be dangerous in low concentrations, like in the low 1 digit parts per billion. However, it is concerning that as a pollutant, it has become more concentrated in some bodies of water. Atrazine doesn’t deserve the hate it gets, but that also doesn’t mean it is perfectly safe. For more current information, such as the concentration at which aquatic plants are impacted (as of March 2025, it is 9.7 micrograms per liter), visit the EPA’s page on atrazine at https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/atrazine.   <br>

### Rapamycin

<br>
Rapamycin is an unusual immunosuppressant discovered on Easter Island (Rapa Nui), quite different from the other molecules discussed here in terms of structure, uses, and how it relates to the environment. Rapamycin was extracted from <em>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</em> on Easter Island in 1972. Since then, this drug has gone from being a believed antifungal agent to now being recognized as a life-saving immunosuppressant among other effects. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) which doesn’t initially tell us anything about its function because it is part of the definition. I am not a biologist so I will try to keep this explanation simple. mTOR is an enzyme which is basically responsible for regulating cell growth and proliferation. By inhibiting it, cell growth is decreased. Besides the simple use of it as an immunosuppressant for transplants, this growth regulation opens numerous possibilities. For example, diseases or conditions which cause growths, whether they be cancerous or not, including tuberous sclerosis complex and potentially even cancer can be treated with rapamycin. In fact, it may even slow aging and increase life spans. It is certain there is a lot to research currently regarding both positive and negative effects of this drug. The main reason I have selected this molecule this week is not due to its potentially miraculous effects: I have selected it due to the question of biodiversity. We know conclusively that biodiversity of flora and fauna are decreasing and that the same holds true for both the skin and gut microbiomes – see Wallen-Russell, Christopher et al (2023). If the biodiversity of bacteria is decreasing in the environment, humanity will be affected in a very interesting way: drug discovery. Drugs like rapamycin are only discovered because they are produced by some strain of bacteria in the wild: even if we can synthesize the drug, we most likely would never have discovered it on our own due to its complexity. It is easy to look at drugs discovered in the Amazon and understand that we are inhibiting the discovery of future drugs due to climate change, fires, and more. But it is also important to consider the molecules discovered in microbes – and the devastating effects of potentially decreasing bacterial biodiversity. What continues to be certain is the vast range of negative effects at all scales due to anthropogenic climate change and pollution. 

### Vasicine
<img src= "https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c23d5c43-58b1-400f-b18e-7d7068dd6cac" alt="Vasicine, an abundant natural product with uses in organic synthesis" width="320" height="200">

<br>
Vasicine is an alkaloid and quinazoline derivative found mainly in <em>Justicia adhatoda</em>, aka Malabar nut. This plant is a flowering shrub native to Asia, mainly parts of South and Southeast Asia. Vasicine, like many other alkaloids, has been historically used in traditional medicines. Vasicine has multiple effects on the body both as a stimulant and a depressant to different organs and systems. While this may be interesting to certain people, I have picked this molecule for an entirely different reason. While researching the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline on my quest to determine if I could synthesize deuterated benzonitrile, I discovered a paper detailing the usage of vasicine as a reducing agent. I was looking for preferably a metal-free, non-dangerous, and cost efficient reaction and I was pleasantly surprised to find this paper, Sharma, Sushila et al (2014). I was further shocked to learn that vasicine was an abundant natural product. As a supporter of green chemistry, I was pleased at how well this reaction works and how economical it is. There are many other redox agents used in green chemistry including vitamin C and other plant extracts, and it is always good to see the discovery of another. For the sake of safety and the environment, I hope that eventually the majority of redox reactions will be done using green chemistry. It is also important to remember the conclusion of the previous molecule of the week: as the climate changes, chemistry will become harder as we may lose access to useful natural products.
