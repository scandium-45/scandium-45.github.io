Perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, is a useful industrial surfactant, meaning that it is used to decrease surface tension of water. It is also used as a material feedstock. PFOA is used in a vast number of places and products including clothes, furniture, waxes, and more, and it does its intended job quite well. The small problem with PFOA is that, like other per and poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), it is a forever chemical, meaning it almost never breaks down. This is largely due to the carbon-fluorine bond, one of the strongest single bonds known. PFOA is also a potential (and likely) carcinogen. Combined with the previously discussed bioaccumulation as a forever chemical, it is easy to see why this and similar compounds are being phased out. <br> <br>
